        "bio": "\n**Simon St. Quentin Whitfield**  (born 16 May 1975 in  [Kingston, Ontario](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingston,_Ontario \"Kingston, Ontario\")) is a retired  [Olympic triathlon champion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Olympic_medalists_in_triathlon \"List of Olympic medalists in triathlon\")  from Canada. Whitfield won 10 consecutive Canadian Triathlon Championships titles and  [carried the Canadian national flag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_flag_bearers_for_Canada_at_the_Olympics \"List of flag bearers for Canada at the Olympics\")  during the  [2000 Summer Olympics closing ceremony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000_Summer_Olympics_closing_ceremony \"2000 Summer Olympics closing ceremony\")  in Sydney, where he had won his gold medal, and the opening ceremony at the  [2012 Summer Olympics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Summer_Olympics \"2012 Summer Olympics\")  in London, making him one of few Canadian athletes to be honoured twice as Olympic flag bearer.\n\n\n## Biography\n\nAs a young boy, Whitfield played  [soccer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soccer \"Soccer\"), until he began with  [triathlon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triathlon \"Triathlon\")  at age 11, honing his early competitive skills in the Canadian  _Kids of Steel_  program. By age 15, he was pursuing triathlon on a serious competitive basis. At present, Whitfield lives in  [Victoria, British Columbia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria,_British_Columbia \"Victoria, British Columbia\")  and maintains his second residence at  [Salt Spring Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_Spring_Island \"Salt Spring Island\").\n\n### Triathlon career\n\nWhitfield won a gold medal in the triathlon at the  [2000 Summer Olympics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000_Summer_Olympics \"2000 Summer Olympics\")  in  [Sydney](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney \"Sydney\"), Australia. He got up off the ground after he and 14 other riders crashed in the bike race portion of the event and worked his way back near the leaders. In the foot race, he cut down the field one at a time then put on a finishing kick to take the victory. His final time was 1:48:24.02, which until 2012 stood as the fastest Olympic triathlon.\n\nIn the  [2002 Commonwealth Games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2002_Commonwealth_Games \"2002 Commonwealth Games\")  in  [Manchester](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester \"Manchester\"), England he claimed gold again. He ended up in 11th place at the  [2004 Summer Olympics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004_Summer_Olympics \"2004 Summer Olympics\")  with a time of 1:53:15.81.\n\nWhitfield was named to the  [2008 Summer Olympics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_Summer_Olympics \"2008 Summer Olympics\")  team and won a silver medal while competing at his third consecutive games.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Whitfield#cite_note-Triathlon-2)  With a time of 1:48:58, he finished 5 seconds behind the German gold medalist.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Whitfield#cite_note-3)  Whitfield's accomplishment was made even more impressive considering he was a distant fourth behind the lead three runners heading into the final kilometre of the run before he burst forth into the lead with 200 metres remaining. Whitfield, exhausted by his effort to get back into the lead, was then passed by the eventual winner  [Jan Frodeno](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jan_Frodeno \"Jan Frodeno\")  of Germany at the end of the race.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Whitfield#cite_note-4)\n\n[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fa/Simon_Whitfield_with_flag.jpg/170px-Simon_Whitfield_with_flag.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Simon_Whitfield_with_flag.jpg)\n\nWhitfield as flag bearer at the  [2012 Olympic Opening Ceremonies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada_at_the_2012_Summer_Olympics \"Canada at the 2012 Summer Olympics\")\n\nWhitfield competed at the  [2012 London Olympics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_London_Olympics \"2012 London Olympics\")  in Triathlon. After finishing 15th in the swim[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Whitfield#cite_note-5)  Whitfield was riding out of transition in his aero-bars when he was caught off balance going over a speed bump, falling off of his bike and breaking his collar bone, forcing him to drop out of the race.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Whitfield#cite_note-6)  Although disappointed, Whitfield remained composed and tactful, apologizing to a fellow athlete who was involved in the crash. Throughout the Olympics Whitfield continued to defend fellow triathlete and Olympic competitor  [Paula Findlay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paula_Findlay \"Paula Findlay\")  from the media when she came last in the women's triathlon in the London games.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Whitfield#cite_note-7)\n\nWhitfield retired in 2013.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Whitfield#cite_note-8)\n\n## Awards and honours\n\nIn 2017, Whitfeld was inducted into  [Canada's Sports Hall of Fame](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada%27s_Sports_Hall_of_Fame \"Canada's Sports Hall of Fame\").[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Whitfield#cite_note-9)",
