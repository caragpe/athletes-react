A two-time  [Olympic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games \"Olympic Games\")  champion in the 100 meters for the  [USA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Olympic_Team \"United States Olympic Team\"), her 1996 win made her only the second woman (after  [Wyomia Tyus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wyomia_Tyus \"Wyomia Tyus\")) to successfully defend an Olympic 100m title. She won a third Olympic gold medal in the 4 × 100 m relay in 1996. She is also the  [1993 World champion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1993_World_Championships_in_Athletics \"1993 World Championships in Athletics\")  in the 100m and a three-time  [World champion in the 100m hurdles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_World_Championships_in_Athletics_medalists_(women) \"List of World Championships in Athletics medalists (women)\"). In 2011, she was inducted into the  [National Track and Field Hall of Fame](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Track_and_Field_Hall_of_Fame \"National Track and Field Hall of Fame\").\n\n## Life and career\n\nDevers was born in  [Seattle, Washington](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle,_Washington \"Seattle, Washington\"), and grew up near  [National City, California](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_City,_California \"National City, California\"), graduating from  [Sweetwater High School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweetwater_High_School_(National_City,_California) \"Sweetwater High School (National City, California)\")  in 1984.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gail_Devers#cite_note-usatf.org-1)  (Sweetwater's football and track stadium would later be named Gail Devers Stadium.) A young talent in the  [100 m](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres \"100 metres\")  and  [100 m hurdles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres_hurdles \"100 metres hurdles\"), Devers was in training for the  [1988 Summer Olympics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1988_Summer_Olympics \"1988 Summer Olympics\"), started experiencing health problems, suffering from among others  [migraine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Migraine \"Migraine\")  and vision loss. She qualified for the Olympics 100 m hurdles, in which she was eliminated in the semi-finals, but her health continued to deteriorate even further.\n\nIn 1990, she was diagnosed with  [Graves' disease](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graves-Basedow_disease \"Graves-Basedow disease\")  and underwent  [radioactive iodine treatment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iodine-131 \"Iodine-131\")  followed by  [thyroid hormone replacement therapy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levothyroxine \"Levothyroxine\"). During her radiation treatment, Devers began to develop blistering and swelling of her feet. Eventually, the sprinter could barely walk and had to crawl and or be carried. A doctor considered amputating her feet. Amazingly, Devers recovered after the radiation treatment was discontinued, and she resumed training. At the 1991 World Championships, she won a  [silver medal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal \"Silver medal\")  in the 100 m hurdles.\n\nAt the  [1992 Summer Olympics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1992_Summer_Olympics \"1992 Summer Olympics\"), Devers starred. She qualified for the final of the 100 m, which ended in an exciting finish, with five women finishing close (within 0.06 seconds). The  [photo finish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photo_finish \"Photo finish\")  showed Devers had narrowly beaten  [Jamaican](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica \"Jamaica\")  [Juliet Cuthbert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juliet_Cuthbert \"Juliet Cuthbert\"). In the final of the 100 m hurdles, Devers' lead event, she seemed to be running towards a second  [gold medal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal \"Gold medal\"), when she hit the final hurdle and stumbled over the finish line in fifth place, leaving  [Voula Patoulidou](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voula_Patoulidou \"Voula Patoulidou\")  from  [Greece](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greece \"Greece\")  as the upset winner.\n\nIn 1993, Devers won the 100 m World Championship title after - again - a photo finish win over  [Merlene Ottey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merlene_Ottey \"Merlene Ottey\")  in an apparent dead heat, and the 100 m hurdles title. She retained her hurdles title in 1995.\n\nThe 100 m final at the  [1996 Summer Olympics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1996_Summer_Olympics \"1996 Summer Olympics\")  was an almost exact repeat of the World Championships final three years before. Ottey and Devers again finished in the same time and did not know who had won the race. Again, both were awarded the same time of 10.94 seconds, but Devers was judged to have finished first and became the first woman to retain the Olympic 100 m title since  [Wyomia Tyus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wyomia_Tyus \"Wyomia Tyus\").  [Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shelly-Ann_Fraser-Pryce \"Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce\")  duplicated the feat in 2012. In the final of her favorite event, Devers again failed, as she finished fourth and outside of the medals. With the  [4 × 100 m relay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4_x_100_metres_relay \"4 x 100 metres relay\")  team, Devers won her third Olympic gold medal.\n\nAfter these Olympics, Devers concentrated on the hurdles event, winning the World Championship again in 1999, but she had to forfeit for the semi-finals at the  [2000 Summer Olympics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000_Summer_Olympics \"2000 Summer Olympics\").\n\nDevers competed in the 100 m and 100 m hurdles at the  [2004 Summer Olympics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004_Summer_Olympics \"2004 Summer Olympics\")  in Athens, her fifth Olympic Games.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gail_Devers#cite_note-3)\n\nDevers left competition in 2005 to give birth to a child with her husband and returned in 2006.\n\nOn February 2, 2007, at the age of 40, Devers edged 2004 Olympic champion  [Joanna Hayes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joanna_Hayes \"Joanna Hayes\")  to win the  [60 m hurdles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/60_metres_hurdles \"60 metres hurdles\")  event at the  [Millrose Games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millrose_Games \"Millrose Games\")  in 7.86 seconds - the best time in the world that season and just 0.12 off the record she set in 2003. Furthermore, the time bettered the listed World Record for a 40-year-old by almost 7 tenths of a second.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gail_Devers#cite_note-4)\n\nDuring her career, Devers was notable for having exceptionally long, heavily decorated fingernails. One of the fastest starters in the world, Devers even had to alter her starting position to accommodate her long nails.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gail_Devers#cite_note-5)  Her long nails came as the result of a contest her father devised to get her to stop biting her nails as a child.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gail_Devers#cite_note-6)\n\nDevers' brother was  [IFBB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Federation_of_BodyBuilding_%26_Fitness \"International Federation of BodyBuilding & Fitness\")  Professional  [Bodybuilder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodybuilder \"Bodybuilder\")  Parenthesis \"PD\" Devers.\n\n## Achievements and recognition\n\nIn 2011, she was elected into the  [National Track and Field Hall of Fame](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Track_and_Field_Hall_of_Fame \"National Track and Field Hall of Fame\"). The following year she was elected into the  [United States Olympic Hall of Fame](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Olympic_Hall_of_Fame \"United States Olympic Hall of Fame\").[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gail_Devers#cite_note-7)  In November 2012, Devers was announced as a 2013 recipient of the  [NCAA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Collegiate_Athletic_Association \"National Collegiate Athletic Association\")  [Silver Anniversary Award](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_Anniversary_Awards_(NCAA) \"Silver Anniversary Awards (NCAA)\"), presented annually to six distinguished former college student-athletes on the 25th anniversary of the end of their college sports careers.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gail_Devers#cite_note-8)",
