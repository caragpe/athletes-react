When Phelps and his teammates captured the gold, Thorpe gave a congratulatory kiss to Phelps's mother, then gave a handshake and a hug to congratulate Phelps. Afterwards, Thorpe said \"I'm really proud of him not just because he won eight golds. Rather, it's how much he has grown up and matured into a great human being.
