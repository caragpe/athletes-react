He is a world record holder in the  [100 metres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres \"100 metres\"),  [200 metres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/200_metres \"200 metres\")  and  [4 × 100 metres relay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4_%C3%97_100_metres_relay \"4 × 100 metres relay\"). Owing to his achievements and dominance in sprint competition, he is widely considered to be the greatest sprinter of all time.[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt#cite_note-15)[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt#cite_note-16)[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt#cite_note-17)[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt#cite_note-18)\n\nAn eight-time  [Olympic gold medallist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_multiple_Olympic_gold_medalists \"List of multiple Olympic gold medalists\"), Bolt is the only sprinter to win  [Olympic 100 m](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres_at_the_Olympics \"100 metres at the Olympics\")  and  [200 m](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/200_metres_at_the_Olympics \"200 metres at the Olympics\")  titles at three consecutive Olympics (2008, 2012 and 2016). In addition he won two 4 × 100 relay gold medals. He gained worldwide fame for his double sprint victory in world record times at the  [2008 Beijing Olympics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_Summer_Olympics \"2008 Summer Olympics\"), which made him the first person to hold both records since  [fully automatic time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fully_automatic_time \"Fully automatic time\")  became mandatory.\n\nAn eleven-time  [World Champion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Championships_in_Athletics \"World Championships in Athletics\"), he won consecutive  [World Championship 100 m](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres_at_the_World_Championships_in_Athletics \"100 metres at the World Championships in Athletics\"),  [200 m](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/200_metres_at_the_World_Championships_in_Athletics \"200 metres at the World Championships in Athletics\")  and  [4 × 100 metres relay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4_%C3%97_100_metres_relay_at_the_World_Championships_in_Athletics \"4 × 100 metres relay at the World Championships in Athletics\")  gold medals from 2009 to 2015, with the exception of a 100 m  [false start](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_start \"False start\")  in 2011. He is the  [most successful athlete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IAAF_World_Championships_in_Athletics#Multiple_medallist \"IAAF World Championships in Athletics\")  of the World Championships. Bolt is the first athlete to win four World Championship titles in the 200 m and is the joint-most successful in the 100 m with three titles.\n\nBolt improved upon his second  [100 m world record](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Men%27s_100_metres_world_record_progression \"Men's 100 metres world record progression\")  of 9.69 with 9.58 seconds in 2009 – the biggest improvement since the start of electronic timing. He has twice broken the  [200 metres world record](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Men%27s_200_metres_world_record_progression \"Men's 200 metres world record progression\"), setting 19.30 in 2008 and 19.19 in 2009. He has helped Jamaica to three  [4 × 100 metres relay world records](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Men%27s_4_%C3%97_100_metres_relay_world_record_progression \"Men's 4 × 100 metres relay world record progression\"), with the current record being 36.84 seconds set in 2012. Bolt's most successful event is the 200 m, with three Olympic and four World titles. The 2008 Olympics was his international debut over 100 m; he had earlier won numerous 200 m medals (including  [2007 World Championship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_World_Championships_in_Athletics \"2007 World Championships in Athletics\")  silver) and holds the  [world under-20](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_world_junior_records_in_athletics \"List of world junior records in athletics\")  and  [world under-18 records](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_world_youth_bests_in_athletics \"List of world youth bests in athletics\")  for the event.\n\nHis achievements as a sprinter have earned him the media nickname \"Lightning Bolt\", and his awards include the  [IAAF World Athlete of the Year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IAAF_World_Athlete_of_the_Year \"IAAF World Athlete of the Year\"),  [Track & Field Athlete of the Year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_%26_Field_Athlete_of_the_Year \"Track & Field Athlete of the Year\"),  [BBC Overseas Sports Personality of the Year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Overseas_Sports_Personality_of_the_Year \"BBC Overseas Sports Personality of the Year\")  (three times) and  [Laureus World Sportsman of the Year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laureus_World_Sports_Award_for_Sportsman_of_the_Year \"Laureus World Sports Award for Sportsman of the Year\")  (four times). Bolt retired after the  [2017 World Championships](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_World_Championships_in_Athletics \"2017 World Championships in Athletics\"), when he finished third in his last solo 100 m race, opted out of the 200 m, and pulled up in the 4×100 m relay final.\n\nStating that it was his \"dream\" to play professional  [association football](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football \"Association football\"), in August 2018 Bolt began training with Australian  [A-League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A-League \"A-League\")  club the  [Central Coast Mariners](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Coast_Mariners_FC \"Central Coast Mariners FC\")  as a  [left-winger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winger_(association_football) \"Winger (association football)\"). On 12 October 2018, Bolt scored twice for the team in a friendly match. He left the club the following month, and in January 2019 chose not to pursue a career in football.[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt#cite_note-19)\n\n## Early years\n\nBolt was born on 21 August 1986 to parents Wellesley and Jennifer Bolt[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt#cite_note-IAAFProfile-12)  in  [Sherwood Content](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherwood_Content \"Sherwood Content\"),[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt#cite_note-guardian1-20)  a small town in Jamaica. He has a brother, Sadiki,[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt#cite_note-21)  and a sister, Sherine.[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt#cite_note-Helps-22)[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt#cite_note-si-23)  His parents ran the local grocery store in the rural area, and Bolt spent his time playing  [cricket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_(sport) \"Cricket (sport)\")  and  [football](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football \"Association football\")  in the street with his brother,[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt#cite_note-24)  later saying, \"When I was young, I didn't really think about anything other than sports.\"[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt#cite_note-BrillBolt-25)  As a child, Bolt attended Waldensia Primary, where he began showing his sprint potential when he ran in his parish's annual national primary school meet.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt#cite_note-Focus-1)  By the age of twelve, Bolt had become the school's fastest runner over the  [100 metres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres \"100 metres\")  distance.[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt#cite_note-26)\n\nUpon his entry to  [William Knibb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Knibb \"William Knibb\")  Memorial High School, Bolt continued to focus on other sports, but his cricket coach noticed Bolt's speed on the pitch and urged him to try track and field events.[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt#cite_note-BBC10-27)  [Pablo McNeil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pablo_McNeil \"Pablo McNeil\"), a former Olympic sprint athlete,[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt#cite_note-McNeil-28)  and Dwayne Jarrett coached Bolt,[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt#cite_note-Jarrett-29)  encouraging him to focus his energy on improving his athletic abilities. The school had a history of success in athletics with past students, including sprinter  [Michael Green](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Green_(sprinter) \"Michael Green (sprinter)\").[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt#cite_note-Focus-1)  Bolt won his first annual  [high school championships](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter-Secondary_Schools_Boys_and_Girls_Championships \"Inter-Secondary Schools Boys and Girls Championships\")  medal in 2001; he took the silver medal in the  [200 metres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/200_m \"200 m\")  with a time of 22.04 seconds.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt#cite_note-Focus-1)  McNeil soon became his primary coach, and the two enjoyed a positive partnership, although McNeil was occasionally frustrated by Bolt's lack of dedication to his training and his penchant for practical jokes.[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt#cite_note-McNeil-28)\n\nWhen Bolt was a boy, he attended Sherwood Content  [Seventh-day Adventist Church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seventh-day_Adventist_Church \"Seventh-day Adventist Church\")  in  [Trelawny](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trelawny_Parish \"Trelawny Parish\"), Jamaica, with his  [mother](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mother \"Mother\"). His mother didn't serve  [pork](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pork \"Pork\")  to him in accordance with Adventist beliefs.[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt#cite_note-30)\n\n### Early competitions\n\nPerforming for Jamaica in his first Caribbean regional event, Bolt clocked a personal best time of 48.28 s in the  [400 metres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/400_metres \"400 metres\")  in the 2001  [CARIFTA Games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CARIFTA_Games \"CARIFTA Games\"), winning a silver medal. The 200 m also yielded a silver, as Bolt finished in 21.81 s.[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt#cite_note-Carifta-31)\n\nHe made his first appearance on the world stage at the  [2001 IAAF World Youth Championships](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001_World_Youth_Championships_in_Athletics \"2001 World Youth Championships in Athletics\")  in  [Debrecen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debrecen \"Debrecen\"), Hungary. Running in the 200 m event, he failed to qualify for the finals, but he still set a new personal best of 21.73 s.[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt#cite_note-32)  Bolt still did not take athletics or himself too seriously, however, and he took his mischievousness to new heights by hiding in the back of a van when he was supposed to be preparing for the 200 m finals at the CARIFTA Trials. He was detained by the police for his practical joke, and there was an outcry from the local community, which blamed coach McNeil for the incident.[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt#cite_note-McNeil-28)  However, the controversy subsided, and both McNeil and Bolt went to the CARIFTA Games, where Bolt set championship records in the 200 m and 400 m with times of 21.12 s and 47.33 s, respectively.[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt#cite_note-Carifta-31)  He continued to set records with 20.61 s and 47.12 s finishes at the  [Central American and Caribbean Junior Championships](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_American_and_Caribbean_Junior_Championships \"Central American and Caribbean Junior Championships\").[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt#cite_note-33)\n\nBolt is one of only nine athletes (along with  [Valerie Adams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valerie_Adams \"Valerie Adams\"),  [Veronica Campbell-Brown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veronica_Campbell-Brown \"Veronica Campbell-Brown\"),  [Jacques Freitag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Freitag \"Jacques Freitag\"),  [Yelena Isinbayeva](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yelena_Isinbayeva \"Yelena Isinbayeva\"),  [Jana Pittman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jana_Pittman \"Jana Pittman\"),  [Dani Samuels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dani_Samuels \"Dani Samuels\"),  [David Storl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Storl \"David Storl\"), and  [Kirani James](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirani_James \"Kirani James\")) to win world championships at the youth, junior, and senior level of an athletic event. Former Prime Minister  [P. J. Patterson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P._J._Patterson \"P. J. Patterson\")  recognised Bolt's talent and arranged for him to move to  [Kingston](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingston,_Jamaica \"Kingston, Jamaica\"), along with  [Jermaine Gonzales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jermaine_Gonzales \"Jermaine Gonzales\"), so he could train with the  [Jamaica Amateur Athletic Association](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica_Amateur_Athletic_Association \"Jamaica Amateur Athletic Association\")  (JAAA) at the  [University of Technology, Jamaica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Technology,_Jamaica \"University of Technology, Jamaica\").[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt#cite_note-McNeil-28)\n\n### Rise to prominence\n\nThe  [2002 World Junior Championships](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2002_World_Junior_Championships_in_Athletics \"2002 World Junior Championships in Athletics\")  were held in front of a home crowd in Kingston, Jamaica, and Bolt was given a chance to prove his credentials on a world stage. By the age of 15, he had grown to 1.96 metres (6 ft 5 in) tall, and he physically stood out among his peers.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt#cite_note-Focus-1)  He won the 200 m in a time of 20.61 s,[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt#cite_note-34)  which was 0.03 s slower than his personal best of 20.58 s, which he set in the 1st round.[[33]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt#cite_note-35)  Bolt's 200 m win made him the youngest world-junior gold medallist ever.[[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt#cite_note-Longmore-36)  The expectation from the home crowd had made him so nervous that he had put his shoes on the wrong feet, although he realized the mistake before the race began[[35]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt#cite_note-37). However, it turned out to be a revelatory experience for Bolt, as he vowed never again to let himself be affected by pre-race nerves.[[36]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt#cite_note-38)  As a member of the Jamaican  [sprint relay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_relay \"Sprint relay\")  team, he also took two silver medals and set national junior records in the  [4×100 metres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4_%C3%97_100_metres_relay \"4 × 100 metres relay\")  and  [4×400 metres relay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4_%C3%97_400_metres_relay \"4 × 400 metres relay\"), running times of 39.15 s and 3:04.06 minutes respectively.[[37]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt#cite_note-39)[[38]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt#cite_note-40)\n\nThe rush of medals continued as he won four golds at the  [2003 CARIFTA Games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003_CARIFTA_Games \"2003 CARIFTA Games\")  and was awarded the  [Austin Sealy Trophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CARIFTA_Games#Austin_Sealy_Award_Winners \"CARIFTA Games\")  for the most outstanding athlete of the games.[[39]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt#cite_note-carifta1-41)[[40]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt#cite_note-carifta2-42)[[41]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt#cite_note-43)  He won another gold at the  [2003 World Youth Championships](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003_World_Youth_Championships_in_Athletics \"2003 World Youth Championships in Athletics\"). He set a new championship record in the 200 m with a time of 20.40 s, despite a 1.1  [m/s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre_per_second \"Metre per second\")  [head wind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_m#Climatic_conditions \"100 m\").[[42]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt#cite_note-44)  [Michael Johnson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Johnson_(athlete) \"Michael Johnson (athlete)\"), the 200 m world-record holder, took note of Bolt's potential but worried that the young sprinter might be over-pressured, stating, \"It's all about what he does three, four, five years down the line\".[[43]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt#cite_note-Thunder-45)  Bolt had also impressed the athletics hierarchy, and he received the  [IAAF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IAAF \"IAAF\")  Rising Star Award for 2002.[[44]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt#cite_note-Beyond-46)\n\nBolt competed in his final Jamaican High School Championships in 2003. He broke the 200 m and 400 m records with times of 20.25 s and 45.35 s, respectively. Bolt's runs were a significant improvement upon the previous records, beating the 200 m best by more than half a second and the 400 m record by almost a second.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt#cite_note-Focus-1)  While Bolt improved upon the 200 m time three months later, setting the still-standing  [World youth best](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_world_youth_bests_in_athletics \"List of world youth bests in athletics\")  at the  [2003 Pan American Junior Championships](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003_Pan_American_Junior_Championships \"2003 Pan American Junior Championships\").[[45]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt#cite_note-47)  The 400 m time remains No. 6 on the all-time youth list, surpassed only once since, by future Olympic champion  [Kirani James](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirani_James \"Kirani James\").[[46]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt#cite_note-48)\n\nBolt turned his main focus to the 200 m and equalled  [Roy Martin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roy_Martin_(sprinter) \"Roy Martin (sprinter)\")'s  [world junior record](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_world_junior_records_in_athletics \"List of world junior records in athletics\")  of 20.13 s at the Pan-American Junior Championships.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt#cite_note-Focus-1)[[47]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt#cite_note-49)  This performance attracted interest from the press, and his times in the 200 m and 400 m led to him being touted as a possible successor to Johnson. Indeed, at sixteen years old, Bolt had reached times that Johnson did not register until he was twenty, and Bolt's 200 m time was superior to  [Maurice Greene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maurice_Greene_(athlete) \"Maurice Greene (athlete)\")'s season's best that year.[[43]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt#cite_note-Thunder-45)\n\nBolt was growing more popular in his homeland. Howard Hamilton, who was given the task of Public Defender by the government, urged the JAAA to nurture him and prevent  [burnout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burnout_(psychology) \"Burnout (psychology)\"), calling Bolt \"the most phenomenal sprinter ever produced by this island\".[[43]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt#cite_note-Thunder-45)  His popularity and the attractions of the capital city were beginning to be a burden to the young sprinter. Bolt was increasingly unfocused on his athletic career and preferred to eat fast food, play basketball, and party in Kingston's club scene. In the absence of a disciplined lifestyle, he became ever-more reliant on his natural ability to beat his competitors on the track.[[48]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt#cite_note-50)\n\nAs the reigning 200 m champion at both the World Youth and World Junior championships, Bolt hoped to take a clean sweep of the world 200 m championships in the  [Senior World Championships](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003_World_Championships_in_Athletics \"2003 World Championships in Athletics\")  in Paris.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt#cite_note-Focus-1)  He beat all comers at the 200 m in the World Championship trials. Bolt was pragmatic about his chances and noted that, even if he did not make the final, he would consider setting a personal best a success.[[43]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt#cite_note-Thunder-45)[[49]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt#cite_note-WC03-51)  However, he suffered a bout of  [conjunctivitis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjunctivitis \"Conjunctivitis\")  before the event, and it ruined his training schedule.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt#cite_note-Focus-1)  Realising that he would not be in peak condition, the JAAA refused to let him participate in the finals, on the grounds that he was too young and inexperienced. Bolt was dismayed at missing out on the opportunity, but focused on getting himself in shape to gain a place on the Jamaican Olympic team instead.[[49]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt#cite_note-WC03-51)  Even though he missed the World Championships, Bolt was awarded the IAAF Rising Star Award for the 2003 season on the strength of his junior record-equalling run.[[44]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt#cite_note-Beyond-46)[[50]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt#cite_note-52)\n## Personal life\n\n[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5e/Usain_Bolt_2011_World_Athletics_Gala.jpg/220px-Usain_Bolt_2011_World_Athletics_Gala.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Usain_Bolt_2011_World_Athletics_Gala.jpg)\n\nBolt with the IAAF men's  [Athlete of the Year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IAAF_World_Athlete_of_the_Year \"IAAF World Athlete of the Year\")  award in  [Monaco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monaco \"Monaco\")\n\nBolt expresses a love for dancing and his character is frequently described as laid-back and relaxed.[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt#cite_note-BBC10-27)[[256]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt#cite_note-258)  His Jamaican track and field idols include  [Herb McKenley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herb_McKenley \"Herb McKenley\")  and former Jamaican 100 m and 200 m world record holder,  [Don Quarrie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Quarrie \"Don Quarrie\").  [Michael Johnson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Johnson_(sprinter) \"Michael Johnson (sprinter)\"), the former 200 m world and Olympic record holder, is also held in high esteem by Bolt.[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt#cite_note-BBC10-27)\n\nBolt has the nickname \"Lightning Bolt\" due to his name and speed.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt#cite_note-Focus-1)  He is  [Catholic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholicism \"Catholicism\")  and known for making the  [sign of the cross](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sign_of_the_cross \"Sign of the cross\")  before racing competitively, and he wears a  [Miraculous Medal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miraculous_Medal \"Miraculous Medal\")  during his races. His middle name is St. Leo.[[257]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt#cite_note-catholicnewsagency1-259)\n\nIn 2010, Bolt also revealed his fondness of music, when he played a  [reggae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reggae \"Reggae\")  DJ set to a crowd in Paris.[[258]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt#cite_note-260)  He is also an avid fan of the  _[Call of Duty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_of_Duty \"Call of Duty\")_  video game series, saying, \"I stay up late [playing the game online], I can't help it.\"[[259]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt#cite_note-261)\n\nIn his autobiography, Bolt reveals that he has suffered from  [scoliosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scoliosis \"Scoliosis\"), a condition that has curved his spine to the right and has made his right leg half an inch shorter than his left.[[260]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt#cite_note-262)  A result of this is that his left leg remains on the ground 14 percent longer than his right leg, with left leg striking with 955 lbs of force and right with 1080 lbs. Biomechanics researchers have studied, with no firm conclusions, whether this asymmetry has helped or hurt Bolt in his sprinting career.[[261]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt#cite_note-263)\n\nHe popularised the \"lightning bolt\" pose, also known as \"to di world\" or \"bolting\", which he used both before races and in celebration.
