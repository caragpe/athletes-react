Nicknamed the \"Russian Bear\",[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleksandr_Karelin#cite_note-2)  \"Russian King Kong\",[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleksandr_Karelin#cite_note-3)  \"Alexander the Great\" and \"The Experiment\", he is considered the greatest Greco-Roman wrestler of all time.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleksandr_Karelin#cite_note-pr-1)[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleksandr_Karelin#cite_note-4)[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleksandr_Karelin#cite_note-5)  Karelin won gold medals at the 1988, 1992 and 1996  [Olympic Games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games \"Olympic Games\")  under a different flag each time (Soviet Union, Unified Team and Russia respectively), and a silver medal at the 2000 Olympic Games. His wrestling record is 887 wins and two losses.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleksandr_Karelin#cite_note-6)[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleksandr_Karelin#cite_note-7)[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleksandr_Karelin#cite_note-8)  Karelin was the national flag bearer at three consecutive Olympics: in 1988 for the Soviet Union, in 1992 for the  [Unified Team](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Team_at_the_Olympics \"Unified Team at the Olympics\"), and in 1996 for Russia.\n\n## Wrestling career\n\nKarelin was born as a 5.5 kilograms (12 lb) baby.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleksandr_Karelin#cite_note-karelinru2-9)  He began training in 1981, under Viktor Kuznetsov, who remained his coach through his entire career.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleksandr_Karelin#cite_note-iat-10)[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleksandr_Karelin#cite_note-pr-1)  Before that he tried boxing, weightlifting, volleyball, basketball and skiing.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleksandr_Karelin#cite_note-fizvosp-11)  Karelin went undefeated for the first time from 1982 to 1987 and second time from 1987 to 2000. In 1985 he came to international competitions and won a junior world title.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleksandr_Karelin#cite_note-pr-1)  He had his first loss (score 0–1) at the USSR championships in 1987, to the reigning Russian and European champion  [Igor Rostorotsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Igor_Rostorotsky \"Igor Rostorotsky\"); he defeated Rostorotsky at the next USSR championships while recovering from a flu and a recent concussion.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleksandr_Karelin#cite_note-pr-1)\n\nIn the 1988 Olympic final Karelin was losing to  [Rangel Gerovski](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rangel_Gerovski \"Rangel Gerovski\"), but with 15 seconds left managed to execute his favorite  [Karelin Lift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suplex#Karelin_lift \"Suplex\")  and won.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleksandr_Karelin#cite_note-pr-1)  At the 1996 Summer Olympic Games in Atlanta, Karelin faced American  [Matt Ghaffari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Ghaffari \"Matt Ghaffari\")  for the gold medal. Karelin had come off a shoulder surgery and looked vulnerable against a strong Ghaffari, who was able to repel Karelin's efforts to lift and slam him, forcing Karelin to use all of his skill and experience to defend a 1–0 lead.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleksandr_Karelin#cite_note-autogenerated2000-12)\n\nAfter going 13 years undefeated in international competition and six years without giving up a point, he lost 0–1 to  [Rulon Gardner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rulon_Gardner \"Rulon Gardner\")  of the  [United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States \"United States\")  in the final of the  [Sydney Olympics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000_Summer_Olympics \"2000 Summer Olympics\").[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleksandr_Karelin#cite_note-Miracle-13)[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleksandr_Karelin#cite_note-14)[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleksandr_Karelin#cite_note-15)  Karelin retired from competitions in 2000.[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleksandr_Karelin#cite_note-16)\n\n### Wrestling style\n\nKarelin was revered for his extraordinary strength and unprecedented success in international competition. He competed at the heaviest weight class of his day, 130 kg (286 lb). His conditioning and quickness combined with his dominance of the sport, led to him being known as \"The Experiment\". When asked why he thought he was called that, Karelin noted that others do not understand because \"I train every day of my life as they have never trained a day in theirs\".[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleksandr_Karelin#cite_note-Winner-17)  His coach was at first skeptical about a big but powerless boy, yet he accepted Karelin and motivated him for hard training, both in wrestling technique and physical strength. As a result, over the years Karelin progressed from 0 to 42  [pull-ups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pull-up_(exercise) \"Pull-up (exercise)\").[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleksandr_Karelin#cite_note-karelinru2-9)[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleksandr_Karelin#cite_note-lift-18)\n\nKarelin was famous for his reverse body lift, the Karelin Lift, where facing the opponent who was lying flat on the mat to keep from being thrown, Karelin hoisted his opponents into the air and slammed them violently to the mat. This devastatingly effective maneuver, when properly executed, awarded Karelin 5 points per throw, the maximum awarded in Greco-Roman wrestling. The throw had long been in use by lighter wrestlers but not by heavyweights – because of the immense strength required to raise, spin and hit the mat with a 560+ lbs combined weight of both athletes (280+ of which resist desperately to the performed manoeuver). Karelin's ability to perform this throw against elite opponents weighing as much as 130 kg amazed other participants and observers of the sport.[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleksandr_Karelin#cite_note-lift-18)  In 889 fights, Karelin used the reverse body lift on circa 800 occasions, in some cases several times per round.[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleksandr_Karelin#cite_note-19)\n\n### Injuries\n\nLike most top wrestlers, Karelin had a number of severe injuries through his career. He credits his fast recoveries to Valery Okhapkin, physician of the national wrestling team, and claims that Okhapkin extended his competition lifetime by several years.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleksandr_Karelin#cite_note-pr-1)\n\nAt the age of 15 Karelin broke his leg while training; having learned about this accident his mother burned his wrestling uniform and forbade him to wrestle. Since then he broke his arms twice and ribs thirteen times. Around January 1988 he had a serious concussion, and doctors considered removing him from the 1988 Olympic team. Karelin won the 1993 World Championships despite breaking two ribs in the opening bout against  [Matt Ghaffari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Ghaffari \"Matt Ghaffari\"). At the 1996 European Championships in Budapest, he had torn the right chest muscle so badly that doctors predicted he would not be able to use his right hand for several months. Karelin won the Championships, but had to be urgently operated on in Budapest. He recovered within three months to compete at the 1996 Olympics.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleksandr_Karelin#cite_note-pr-1)",
