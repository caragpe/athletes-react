After losing the first set, and facing match point in the decider at 5–6, Murray eventually took the match in a third-set tiebreaker to win his second Miami Masters title, and leapfrog Roger Federer into second place in the rankings, ending a near-decade long time period in which either Federer or Rafael Nadal were ranked in the top two.[[216]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-216)  Murray briefly fell back to No. 3, following a third round defeat by Stanislas Wawrinka in  [Monte-Carlo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_Monte-Carlo_Rolex_Masters \"2013 Monte-Carlo Rolex Masters\"), but reclaimed the No. 2 ranking as a result of Federer failing to defend his title at the  [Mutua Madrid Open](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_Mutua_Madrid_Open \"2013 Mutua Madrid Open\"). Later, Murray lost at the quarter-final stage to Tomáš Berdych in straight sets.[[217]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-217)\n\nAt the  [Rome Masters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_Open_(tennis) \"Italian Open (tennis)\"), Murray retired due to a hip injury during his second round match against  [Marcel Granollers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcel_Granollers \"Marcel Granollers\")  on his 26th birthday. Murray had just battled back to tie the match at one set all after winning the second set on a tiebreak. This left Murray with only eleven days to be fit for the start of the  [French Open](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_French_Open \"2013 French Open\").[[218]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-218)\n\nSpeaking at a press conference after the match, Murray said, \"As it is, I'd be very surprised if I was playing in Paris. I need to make a plan as to what I do. I'll chat with the guys tonight and make a plan for the next few days then make a decision on Paris after the next five days.\"[[219]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-219)  He would go on to withdraw from Roland Garros later, citing a back injury.[[220]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-220)  After a four-week break due to injury, Murray made his comeback at the  [2013 Aegon Championships](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_Aegon_Championships \"2013 Aegon Championships\"), where he was the top seed. After a rain delayed first day, Murray had to complete his second round match against Nicolas Mahut, and his subsequent match against  [Marinko Matosevic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marinko_Matosevic \"Marinko Matosevic\")  on the same day, both of which he won in straight sets. After beating  [Benjamin Becker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Becker \"Benjamin Becker\")  in the quarter-finals, Murray next faced his first top ten opponent since losing to Tomáš Berdych in Madrid, taking on Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in the semi-finals. After dropping the first set against the Frenchman, Murray eventually raised his level and won in three to set up a final against Marin Čilić of Croatia, his third consecutive final on grass courts. He came from behind again to beat Čilić in three sets to claim his third title at  [Queen's Club](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen%27s_Club_Championships \"Queen's Club Championships\").[[221]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-221)\n\n[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ad/AndyMurrayWimbledonTrophyCropped.jpg/170px-AndyMurrayWimbledonTrophyCropped.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:AndyMurrayWimbledonTrophyCropped.jpg)\n\nMurray holds the Wimbledon trophy following his victory in the  [2013 men's final](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_Wimbledon_Championships_%E2%80%93_Men%27s_Singles_final \"2013 Wimbledon Championships – Men's Singles final\")\n\nGoing into Wimbledon, Murray had not lost a match on grass since the previous year's final, and was on a winning streak of 11 matches on grass. In the first two rounds, Murray faced Benjamin Becker[[222]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-222)  and Yen-hsun Lu[[223]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-223)  respectively, defeating both in straight sets. His third round match was against 32nd seed  [Tommy Robredo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_Robredo \"Tommy Robredo\"), and despite a tour comeback over the past year, Murray overcame the Spaniard in straight sets to set up a clash with  [Mikhail Youzhny](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Youzhny \"Mikhail Youzhny\"), the highest seed left in Murray's half following the unexpectedly early exits of Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal.[[224]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-224)  Despite facing a fightback in the second set, Murray won in straight sets to make it through to his tenth consecutive Grand Slam quarter-final,[[225]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-225)  in which he was to play Fernando Verdasco, the first left-handed player Murray had faced since the  [2012 US Open](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_US_Open_(tennis) \"2012 US Open (tennis)\"). For the seventh time in his career, Murray had to come back from a deficit of two sets to ultimately come through in five,[[226]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-226)  setting up a semi-final clash with 24th seed  [Jerzy Janowicz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerzy_Janowicz \"Jerzy Janowicz\"), the Polish player who beat Murray in their previous encounter. After Murray failed to break Janowicz's serve, the Pole took the opening set in the tiebreak, following a double fault from Murray. However Murray managed to up his level of play, and won the next three sets, making it through to his second consecutive Wimbledon final, and third consecutive major final against Novak Djokovic.[[227]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-227)\n\nDespite the Serb being the favourite to win the title throughout the Championships, Murray overcame Djokovic in a straight sets match that lasted over three hours, to become the first British winner of the men's singles title since Fred Perry in 1936, the first Scot of either sex to win a Wimbledon singles title since  [Harold Mahony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_Mahony \"Harold Mahony\")  in 1896, and to extend his winning streak on grass to 18 matches.[[228]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-228)\n\nAt the  [US Open](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_US_Open_%E2%80%93_Men%27s_Singles \"2013 US Open – Men's Singles\"), Murray entered a Grand Slam tournament as defending champion for the first time, and started strongly with a straight sets win against  [Michaël Llodra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micha%C3%ABl_Llodra \"Michaël Llodra\"). He backed this up with wins over  [Leonardo Mayer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonardo_Mayer \"Leonardo Mayer\"), Florian Mayer and  [Denis Istomin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denis_Istomin \"Denis Istomin\")  to reach the quarter-finals at a major for the 11th straight tournament. In the last 8, Murray faced Stanislas Wawrinka of Switzerland, but lost in straight sets, ending Murray's streak of four consecutive major finals.[[229]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-229)  Following his disappointing run of form on hard courts, Murray next joined the  [Great Britain Davis Cup team](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Britain_Davis_Cup_team \"Great Britain Davis Cup team\")  in their  [World Group Play-off](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_Davis_Cup_World_Group_Play-offs \"2013 Davis Cup World Group Play-offs\")  tie on clay against  [Croatia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatia_Davis_Cup_team \"Croatia Davis Cup team\"), where he played in two singles and the doubles rubbers. After defeating 16-year-old  [Borna Ćorić](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borna_%C4%86ori%C4%87 \"Borna Ćorić\")  in straight sets, Murray teamed up with  [Colin Fleming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colin_Fleming \"Colin Fleming\")  to defeat Croatian number 1 Ivan Dodig and  [Mate Pavić](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mate_Pavi%C4%87 \"Mate Pavić\")  in the doubles, and take a 2–1 lead in the tie. Murray then sealed Britain's return to the  [World Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Davis_Cup_World_Group \"2014 Davis Cup World Group\")  by defeating Dodig in straight sets.[[230]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-230)\n\nFollowing the Davis Cup, Murray's season was cut short by his decision to undergo surgery, in order to sort out the lower back problems that had caused him problems since the early stages of the previous season. After being forced to withdraw from the French Open in May, the injury flared up again during the US Open and later during the Davis Cup World Group Play-offs, Murray made the decision that surgery was the best way to sort the problem out for the long-term.[[231]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-231)  Following the conclusion of the 2013 season, Murray was voted the  [2013 BBC Sport Personality of the Year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_BBC_Sports_Personality_of_the_Year_Award \"2013 BBC Sports Personality of the Year Award\"), after having been heavy favourite since the nominees were announced.[[232]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-232)\n\n### 2014: 30th career title and out of top 10\nMain article:  [2014 Andy Murray tennis season](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Andy_Murray_tennis_season \"2014 Andy Murray tennis season\")\n\nMurray started his  [season](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_ATP_World_Tour \"2014 ATP World Tour\")  at the  [Qatar Open](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Qatar_ExxonMobil_Open \"2014 Qatar ExxonMobil Open\")  in Doha. In the first round, he defeated  [Mousa Shanan Zayed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mousa_Shanan_Zayed \"Mousa Shanan Zayed\")  in straight sets in 37 minutes without dropping a single game, but was defeated in three sets by No. 40 Florian Mayer in the second round, despite being a set and a break up three games into the second set.[[233]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-233)  He then played a warm-up match at the  [2014 AAMI Classic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_AAMI_Classic \"2014 AAMI Classic\")  in Kooyong against No. 43 Lleyton Hewitt, losing in two close tiebreaks.\n\nHe next headed to Melbourne for the  [2014 Australian Open](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Australian_Open_%E2%80%93_Men%27s_Singles \"2014 Australian Open – Men's Singles\"), where he drew the No. 112,  [Go Soeda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_Soeda \"Go Soeda\")  of Japan. Despite worries that he was not match-fit, Murray got off to a strong start, dispatching the Japanese number 2 in under 90 minutes, losing just 5 games in the process. He next went on to defeat  [Vincent Millot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincent_Millot \"Vincent Millot\")  and Feliciano López respectively in straight sets. In the fourth round, Murray dropped his first set of the tournament on his way to beating  [Stephane Robert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephane_Robert \"Stephane Robert\")  in four sets to set up a meeting with long-standing rival Roger Federer in the quarter-finals. Despite saving two match points to take the third set, he ultimately went out in four, ending his streak of four consecutive Australian Open semi-finals.[[234]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-234)  As a result of losing before the final, Murray fell to No. 6, falling out of the top 5 for the first time since 2008.\n\nHe next headed to the United States to compete in the  [Davis Cup World Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Davis_Cup_World_Group#United_States_vs._Great_Britain \"2014 Davis Cup World Group\")  first round with  [Great Britain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Britain_Davis_Cup_team \"Great Britain Davis Cup team\"), who went into the tie as outsiders. Murray won both of his ties against  [Donald Young](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Young_(tennis) \"Donald Young (tennis)\")  and Sam Querrey respectively, helping Britain to their first Davis Cup quarter-final since 1986.[[235]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-235)  Murray's next tournament was the  [Rotterdam Open](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_ABN_AMRO_World_Tennis_Tournament \"2014 ABN AMRO World Tennis Tournament\")  after receiving a late wild card, however he lost to Marin Čilić in straight sets in the quarter-finals. His following competition, the  [Mexican Open](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Abierto_Mexicano_Telcel \"2014 Abierto Mexicano Telcel\")  in Acapulco, ended in a semi-final defeat by Grigor Dimitrov in a thrilling three-setter that required two tiebreakers to decide the final two sets.\n\nAt  [Indian Wells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_BNP_Paribas_Open_%E2%80%93_Men%27s_Singles#Section_2 \"2014 BNP Paribas Open – Men's Singles\"), Murray struggled in his first two matches against  [Lukáš Rosol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luk%C3%A1%C5%A1_Rosol \"Lukáš Rosol\")  and  [Jiří Veselý](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ji%C5%99%C3%AD_Vesel%C3%BD \"Jiří Veselý\")  respectively, overcoming both in close three-set encounters to set up a fourth round clash with Canadian Milos Raonic, which he lost in three sets. Murray offered to play with  [2012 Wimbledon Doubles champion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Wimbledon_Championships_%E2%80%93_Men%27s_Doubles#Finals \"2012 Wimbledon Championships – Men's Doubles\")  [Jonathan Marray](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Marray \"Jonathan Marray\"), because Marray was unable to convince anyone to join him on court.[[236]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-Wimbledon_2014:_Jonny_Marray's_doubles_trouble_ends_in_win_as_he_makes_second_round_with_John-Patrick_Smith-236)  For Murray and Marray's first competitive match together, they won a doubles clash against  [Gaël Monfils](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ga%C3%ABl_Monfils \"Gaël Monfils\")  and  [Juan Mónaco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_M%C3%B3naco \"Juan Mónaco\")  only to lose in the  [second round](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_BNP_Paribas_Open_%E2%80%93_Men%27s_Doubles#Bottom_half \"2014 BNP Paribas Open – Men's Doubles\")  to the No 2 seeds  [Alexander Peya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Peya \"Alexander Peya\")  and  [Bruno Soares](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruno_Soares \"Bruno Soares\").\n\nIn March, Murray split with coach Ivan Lendl, who had been widely praised for helping Murray achieve his goal of winning Grand Slam titles.[[237]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-237)  At the  [2014 Miami Masters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Miami_Masters \"2014 Miami Masters\"), Murray defeated  [Matthew Ebden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Ebden \"Matthew Ebden\"), Feliciano López and Jo Wilfried Tsonga but lost to Djokovic in the quarter-finals.[[238]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-238)  In the  [Davis Cup quarter-finals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Davis_Cup_World_Group#Italy_vs._Great_Britain \"2014 Davis Cup World Group\")  against Italy, he beat  [Andreas Seppi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andreas_Seppi \"Andreas Seppi\")  in his first rubber, then teamed up with Colin Fleming to win the doubles rubber. Murray had only beaten one top ten player on clay, Nikolay Davydenko, back in 2009, and so in his final singles match, was stunned by  [Fabio Fognini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fabio_Fognini \"Fabio Fognini\")  in straight sets, which took Great Britain to the deciding final rubber.[[239]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-Davis_2014_Out-239)  However, in this match his compatriot,  [James Ward](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Ward_(tennis) \"James Ward (tennis)\")  was defeated by Andreas Seppi, also in straight sets, knocking Murray and Great Britain out of the Davis Cup.[[239]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-Davis_2014_Out-239)\n\nMurray next competed at the  [Madrid Open](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Mutua_Madrid_Open \"2014 Mutua Madrid Open\")  and following his opening win, over Nicolas Almagro, he dedicated the victory to former player  [Elena Baltacha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elena_Baltacha \"Elena Baltacha\").[[240]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-240)[[241]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-241)  He then lost to qualifier  [Santiago Giraldo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santiago_Giraldo \"Santiago Giraldo\")  in the following round. Murray then reached the quarter-finals of the  [Rome Masters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internazionali_BNL_d%27Italia \"Internazionali BNL d'Italia\")  where he lost to No. 1 Rafael Nadal in a tight match in which he had been up a break in the final set.[[242]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-242)  At the  [French Open](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_French_Open \"2014 French Open\"), Murray defeated  [Andrey Golubev](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrey_Golubev \"Andrey Golubev\")  and Marinko Matosevic before edging out 28th seed Philipp Kohlschreiber 12–10 in the final set. This was the first time Murray had ever gone beyond 7–5 in a deciding set.[[243]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-243)  He followed this up with a straight sets win over Fernando Verdasco and then recorded a five set victory over Frenchman Gaël Monfils in the quarter-final, which saw Murray rise to No. 5 and equal his best ever  [French Open](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open \"French Open\")  by reaching the semi-finals. However, he subsequently lost to Nadal in straight sets, winning only 6 games in the match.[[244]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-244)  After losing the 2014 French Open semi-finals to Nadal, Murray appointed former women's world No. 1, and two-times slam titlist,  [Amélie Mauresmo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amelie_Mauresmo \"Amelie Mauresmo\")  as his coach[[245]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-245)  in a 'historic move' which made Mauresmo the first woman to coach a top male tennis player.[[246]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-AM_appointed-246)\n\nAfter strong grass court seasons in 2012 and 2013, Murray was seeded third for the 2014 Wimbledon Championship, behind Novak Djokovic and Rafael Nadal, who were seeded first and second respectively.[[247]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-247)  He began his title defence with straight sets wins over  [David Goffin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Goffin \"David Goffin\")[[248]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-248)  and  [Blaž Rola](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bla%C5%BE_Rola \"Blaž Rola\"), defeating the latter for the loss of just two games.[[249]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-249)  Murray continued his good form, defeating  [Roberto Bautista Agut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roberto_Bautista_Agut \"Roberto Bautista Agut\")[[250]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-250)  and Kevin Anderson,[[251]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-251)  the 27th and 20th seeds, again in straight sets to reach his seventh consecutive Wimbledon quarter-final. Murray's defence then came to a halt as Grigor Dimitrov ended his 17 match winning-streak on the grass of Wimbledon (this includes the 2012 Olympics) with a straight sets win, meaning Murray failed to reach the semi-finals for the first time since 2008.[[252]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-252)  After his defeat at the Championships, Murray dropped to No. 10, his lowest ranking since 2008.[[253]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-253)\n\nPrior to the North American hard court swing, Murray announced he was extending his partnership with Amélie Mauresmo until the end of the  [US Open](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Open_(tennis) \"US Open (tennis)\"), but was ideally looking for a long-term deal.[[254]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-254)  He also revealed he had only just returned to a full training schedule following his back surgery last September.[[255]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-255)  Murray reached back-to-back quarter-finals at the  [Canadian Open](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Rogers_Cup \"2014 Rogers Cup\")  and  [Cincinnati Masters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Western_%26_Southern_Open \"2014 Western & Southern Open\"), losing to eventual champions Jo Wilfried Tsonga,[[256]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-256)  after being a break up in the decider,[[257]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-257)  and Roger Federer, after being two breaks up in the second set, respectively.[[258]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-258)  He made it to the quarter-finals of the  [2014 US Open](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_US_Open_(tennis) \"2014 US Open (tennis)\"), losing to  [Novak Djokovic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic \"Novak Djokovic\"), after earning his first top ten win of the year in the previous round against Jo Wilfried Tsonga.[[259]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-259)  This was the first season since 2009 where Murray failed to reach a grand slam final. As a consequence Murray fell outside of the top 10 ranking places for the first time since June 2008.[[260]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-260)\n\nMurray took a wildcard into the inaugural  [Shenzhen Open](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_ATP_Shenzhen_Open \"2014 ATP Shenzhen Open\")  in China, entering as the number 2 seed. Victories over  [Somdev Devvarman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somdev_Devvarman \"Somdev Devvarman\"),  [Lukáš Lacko](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luk%C3%A1%C5%A1_Lacko \"Lukáš Lacko\")  and Juan Mónaco saw Murray reach his first final of the season, breaking a drought of 14 months following his title at Wimbledon.

He lost the opening rubber against Juan Martín del Potro in five sets.[[325]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-325)  After Great Britain lost the second rubber as well, he teamed up with his brother Jamie to beat del Potro and Leonardo Mayer in the third rubber in four sets.[[326]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-326)  He then won the fourth rubber against  [Guido Pella](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guido_Pella \"Guido Pella\")  in straight sets,[[327]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-327)  though Great Britain eventually lost the tie.[[328]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-328)  Murray then won the  [China Open](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_China_Open_%E2%80%93_Men%27s_Singles \"2016 China Open – Men's Singles\")  for his fifth title of 2016 and 40th career tour title. He defeated  [Andreas Seppi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andreas_Seppi \"Andreas Seppi\"),  [Andrey Kuznetsov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrey_Kuznetsov_(tennis) \"Andrey Kuznetsov (tennis)\"),  [Kyle Edmund](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Edmund \"Kyle Edmund\"),  [David Ferrer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Ferrer \"David Ferrer\"), and  [Grigor Dimitrov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grigor_Dimitrov \"Grigor Dimitrov\")  all in straight sets. Murray then backed this up with a tournament win at the  [Shanghai Rolex Masters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Shanghai_Rolex_Masters_%E2%80%93_Singles \"2016 Shanghai Rolex Masters – Singles\")  defeating  [Steve Johnson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Johnson_(tennis) \"Steve Johnson (tennis)\"),  [Lucas Pouille](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucas_Pouille \"Lucas Pouille\"),  [David Goffin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Goffin \"David Goffin\"),  [Gilles Simon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilles_Simon \"Gilles Simon\"), and  [Roberto Bautista Agut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roberto_Bautista_Agut \"Roberto Bautista Agut\")  all in straight sets to capture his 13th masters title and 3rd title in Shanghai. This marked his 6th title of 2016 and drew him even with former No. 1 Stefan Edberg at No. 15 on the Open Era titles list with 41 Tour titles each.\n\nMurray brought his win streak to 15 consecutive match wins by winning the Erste Bank Open for his seventh tour title of the 2016 season. His tournament started slowly with three-set wins over  [Martin Klizan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Klizan \"Martin Klizan\")  and Gilles Simon in the first two rounds. However, a decisive win over  [John Isner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Isner \"John Isner\")  in the quarter-final and a walkover due to David Ferrer's withdrawal with a leg injury saw Murray reach the final.[[329]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-329)  There he defeated Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, for his third title in succession.[[330]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-330)  The result saw Murray win seven titles in a single season for the first time in his career, and move to solo 15th on the  [all-time list of singles titles in the Open Era](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_players_with_most_titles_in_the_Open_Era#Men \"Tennis players with most titles in the Open Era\"), breaking a tie with former world No. 1  [Stefan Edberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefan_Edberg \"Stefan Edberg\").[[331]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-331)\n\nMurray entered the  [Paris Masters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_BNP_Paribas_Masters \"2016 BNP Paribas Masters\")  knowing that in the event of Djokovic not reaching the final, winning the title would be enough to see him crowned world No. 1 for the first time. After reaching the quarter-finals, courtesy of wins over Fernando Verdasco and  [Lucas Pouille](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucas_Pouille \"Lucas Pouille\"), Murray faced Berdych for a place in the semi-finals, winning in straight sets. Meanwhile, Djokovic lost to  [Marin Cilic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marin_Cilic \"Marin Cilic\"), meaning that Murray would replace Djokovic at the top of the rankings should he reach the final. He was due to face Milos Raonic in the semi-finals. However, Raonic withdrew prior to the start of the match, giving Murray a walkover. As a result, Murray became the first British man to reach No. 1 since the introduction of the rankings in 1973.[[332]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-332)  Murray then defeated John Isner in the final in 3 sets to win his fourth consecutive tournament and first Paris Masters title.[[333]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-333)  In November 2016, Murray reached the  [final of the ATP World Tour Finals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_ATP_World_Tour_Finals_%E2%80%93_Singles \"2016 ATP World Tour Finals – Singles\")  for the first time before winning against Novak Djokovic in two sets, thus reaching  [year-end No. 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ATP_number_1_ranked_singles_tennis_players#Year-end_No._1 \"List of ATP number 1 ranked singles tennis players\")[[334]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-334)  and in doing so, becoming the first player to win a Grand Slam, the ATP World Tour Finals, the men's singles at the Olympic Games and a Masters 1000 title in the same calendar year.

They have met five times at the  [ATP World Tour Finals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATP_World_Tour_Finals \"ATP World Tour Finals\"), with Murray winning in Shanghai in 2008[[435]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-435)  and Federer coming out victorious in London in 2009, 2010, 2012, and in 2014.\n\nIn August 2012, Murray met Federer in the  [final of the London 2012 Olympics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_at_the_2012_Summer_Olympics_%E2%80%93_Men%27s_singles \"Tennis at the 2012 Summer Olympics – Men's singles\")  at Wimbledon Centre Court, just four weeks after the  [2012 Wimbledon Final](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Wimbledon_Championships_%E2%80%93_Men%27s_Singles_final \"2012 Wimbledon Championships – Men's Singles final\"), in which Federer had defeated Murray to win his record-tying 7th title at the All-England Club. Murray defeated Federer in straight sets to win the gold medal, denying Federer a  [Career Golden Slam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Career_Golden_Slam \"Career Golden Slam\"). In 2013 Murray beat Federer for the first time in a major in the semi-finals of the  [Australian Open](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_Australian_Open \"2013 Australian Open\"), prevailing in five sets after Federer had come back twice from a set down.[[436]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-436)  Their last grand slam meeting was at the  [2015 Wimbledon Championships](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_Wimbledon_Championships \"2015 Wimbledon Championships\")  semi-finals, where a dominant Federer defeated Murray in straight sets, earning a place in his 10th Wimbledon final. Murray is one of only three players to have recorded 10 or more victories over Federer, the other two being Nadal and Djokovic. Their most recent meeting took place at the  [2015 Cincinnati Masters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_Western_%26_Southern_Open \"2015 Western & Southern Open\")  semi-finals, with Federer winning the match in two close sets, recording his fifth consecutive victory over Murray.[[434]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-h2hFed-434)\n\n### Murray vs. Nadal\n\nMurray has played against  [Rafael Nadal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal \"Rafael Nadal\")  on 24 occasions since  [2007](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_ATP_Tour \"2007 ATP Tour\"), with Nadal leading 17–7. Nadal leads 7–2 on clay, 3–0 on grass and 7–5 on hard courts. The pair regularly meet at  [Grand Slam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis) \"Grand Slam (tennis)\")  level, with nine out of their twenty-four meetings coming in slams, with Nadal leading 7–2 (3–0 at  [Wimbledon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Championships,_Wimbledon \"The Championships, Wimbledon\"), 2–0 at the  [French Open](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open \"French Open\"), 1–1 at the  [Australian Open](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Open \"Australian Open\")  and 1–1 at the  [US Open](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Open_(tennis) \"US Open (tennis)\")).[[437]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-437)  Eight of these nine appearances have been at quarter-final and semi-final level. They have never met in a slam final, however, Murray leads 3–1 in  [ATP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_of_Tennis_Professionals \"Association of Tennis Professionals\")  finals, with Nadal winning at  [Indian Wells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009_BNP_Paribas_Open \"2009 BNP Paribas Open\")  in  [2009](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009_ATP_World_Tour \"2009 ATP World Tour\")[[438]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-438)  and Murray winning in  [Rotterdam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009_ABN_AMRO_World_Tennis_Tournament \"2009 ABN AMRO World Tennis Tournament\")  the same year,[[439]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-439)  [Tokyo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Rakuten_Japan_Open_Tennis_Championships \"2011 Rakuten Japan Open Tennis Championships\")[[440]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-440)  in  [2011](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_ATP_World_Tour \"2011 ATP World Tour\"), and at  [Madrid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_Mutua_Madrid_Open \"2015 Mutua Madrid Open\")  in  [2015](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_ATP_World_Tour \"2015 ATP World Tour\").\n\nMurray lost three consecutive Grand Slam semi-finals to Nadal in 2011 from the  [French Open](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_French_Open \"2011 French Open\")  to the  [US Open](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_US_Open_(tennis) \"2011 US Open (tennis)\"). The pair had not met for three years since the final of the  [2011 Japan Open](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Rakuten_Japan_Open_Tennis_Championships \"2011 Rakuten Japan Open Tennis Championships\")  until the quarter-finals of the  [2014 Rome Masters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Internazionali_BNL_d%27Italia \"2014 Internazionali BNL d'Italia\"), although they were scheduled to meet in the semi-final of the  [2012 Miami Masters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Miami_Masters \"2012 Miami Masters\")  before Nadal withdrew with injury.[[441]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-441)  At the semi-final stage of the  [2014 French Open](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_French_Open \"2014 French Open\"), Nadal triumphed in a dominant straight sets win for the loss of just 6 games. In one of their most recent meetings, Murray beat Nadal for the first time on clay, and the first time in a Masters 1000 final, at the  [Madrid Open](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_Mutua_Madrid_Open \"2015 Mutua Madrid Open\")  in 2015.[[442]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-442)  Murray fell to Nadal in the semi-finals of the  [2016 Monte Carlo Masters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Monte-Carlo_Rolex_Masters_%E2%80%93_Singles \"2016 Monte-Carlo Rolex Masters – Singles\"), despite taking the first set.[[443]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-443)  Three weeks later they met again at the semi-final stage of the  [2016 Madrid Open](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Mutua_Madrid_Open_%E2%80%93_Men%27s_Singles \"2016 Mutua Madrid Open – Men's Singles\"), this time Murray winning the match in straight sets.[[444]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-444)\n\n### Murray vs. Wawrinka\n\nMurray and  [Stan Wawrinka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stan_Wawrinka \"Stan Wawrinka\")  have played 20 times with Murray leading 12–8. Murray leads 8–4 on hard courts and 3–0 on grass courts while Wawrinka leads 4–1 on clay courts. They have also met six times in Grand Slam tournaments with each player winning three matches.[[445]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-445)  They have contested some close matches and one of their most notable matches was in the  [2009 Wimbledon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009_Wimbledon_Championships_%E2%80%93_Men%27s_Singles \"2009 Wimbledon Championships – Men's Singles\")  fourth round which Murray won in five sets and was the first men's match to be played under the Wimbledon roof, having the latest finish for a Wimbledon match at the time.[[446]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-446)  Wawrinka also ended Murray's title defense at the  [2013 US Open](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_US_Open_%E2%80%93_Men%27s_Singles \"2013 US Open – Men's Singles\")  quarter-finals with a comfortable straight sets victory.[[447]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-447)  Other close matches the two have contested include the  [2010 US Open](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_US_Open_%E2%80%93_Men%27s_Singles \"2010 US Open – Men's Singles\")  which Wawrinka won in four sets. Murray won the  [2008 Canada Open](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_Rogers_Masters_%E2%80%93_Singles \"2008 Rogers Masters – Singles\")  and  [2011 Shanghai Masters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Shanghai_Rolex_Masters_%E2%80%93_Singles \"2011 Shanghai Rolex Masters – Singles\").\n\nWhile Murray has led the majority of the rivalry, Wawrinka won their first two matches and beat Murray three consecutive times between 2013 and 2015, winning all of them in straight sets, until Murray ended the losing streak at the  [2016 French Open](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_French_Open_%E2%80%93_Men%27s_Singles \"2016 French Open – Men's Singles\"), beating the defending champion Wawrinka in four sets to reach his first ever French Open final and become the first British man to do so since 1937. Their most recent match was played in the final of the  [2019 European Open](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_European_Open_%E2%80%93_Singles \"2019 European Open – Singles\"), which Murray won in three sets. Due to this match-up and since both players each have three Grand Slam titles, Wawrinka has been identified by some, including Djokovic, as a potential contender to turn the  [Big Four](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Four_(tennis) \"Big Four (tennis)\")  tennis quartet into a \"Big Five\", although Wawrinka himself has downplayed those suggestions, stating that he is still far behind them.[[448]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-448)[[449]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-449)\n\n## Playing style\n\n[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/03/Flickr_-_Carine06_-_Andy_Murray_%2810%29.jpg/170px-Flickr_-_Carine06_-_Andy_Murray_%2810%29.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Flickr_-_Carine06_-_Andy_Murray_(10).jpg)\n\nAt the  [Boodles Challenge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boodles_Challenge \"Boodles Challenge\"), Stoke Park, June 2012\n\nMurray plays an  [all-court](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_strategy#All-court_player \"Tennis strategy\")  game with an emphasis on  [defensive baseline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counterpuncher \"Counterpuncher\")  play, and in 2009 professional tennis coach  [Paul Annacone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Annacone \"Paul Annacone\")  stated that Murray \"may be the best counterpuncher on tour today.\"[[450]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-450)[[451]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-No_surface_tension_as_Murray_looks_to_shed_his_feet_of_clay-451)  His strengths include groundstrokes with low error rate, the ability to anticipate and react, and his transition from defence to offence with speed, which enables him to hit winners from defensive positions. His playing style has been likened to that of  [Miloslav Mečíř](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miloslav_Me%C4%8D%C3%AD%C5%99 \"Miloslav Mečíř\"). Murray also has one of the best two-handed backhands on the tour, with dynamic stroke execution[[452]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-452)  while he primarily uses his forehand, which is more passive, and a sliced backhand to let opponents play into his defensive game before playing more offensively.[[453]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-453)  [Tim Henman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Henman \"Tim Henman\")  stated in 2013 that Murray may have the best  [lob](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lob_(tennis) \"Lob (tennis)\")  in the game, succeeding  [Lleyton Hewitt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lleyton_Hewitt \"Lleyton Hewitt\"). Murray's tactics often involve passive exchanges from the baseline. He is capable of injecting sudden pace into his groundstrokes to surprise his opponents who are used to the slow rally. Murray is also one of the top returners in the game, often able to block back fast serves with his excellent reach and ability to anticipate. For this reason, Murray is rarely aced.[[454]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-454)\n\nMurray is known for being one of the most intelligent tacticians on the court, often constructing points.[[455]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-455)[[456]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-456)  Other strengths in his game, although not huge parts of his game, include his  [drop shot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drop_shot \"Drop shot\")[[457]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-457)  and net game.[[458]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-458)  As he plays predominantly from the baseline, he usually approaches the net to  [volley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volley_(tennis) \"Volley (tennis)\")  when finishing points more quickly.[[459]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-459)  Murray is most proficient on a fast surface, like grass, where he has won eight singles titles including the  [Wimbledon Championships](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Championships,_Wimbledon \"The Championships, Wimbledon\")  and the  [2012 Olympic Gold Medal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_at_the_2012_Summer_Olympics \"Tennis at the 2012 Summer Olympics\"), although hard courts are his preferred surface.[[451]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-No_surface_tension_as_Murray_looks_to_shed_his_feet_of_clay-451)  He has worked hard since 2008 on improving his clay court game,[[460]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-460)  ultimately winning his first clay titles during 2015 at  [Munich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_BMW_Open_%E2%80%93_Singles \"2015 BMW Open – Singles\")  and  [Madrid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_Mutua_Madrid_Open_%E2%80%93_Men%27s_Singles \"2015 Mutua Madrid Open – Men's Singles\"), as well as reaching his first French Open final during 2016. While Murray's  [serve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serve_(tennis) \"Serve (tennis)\")  is a major weapon for him, with his first serve reaching speeds of 130 mph or higher on some occasions and winning him many free points,[[461]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-How_Andy_Murray_turned_a_second_serve_into_a_lethal_weapon-461)  it can become inconsistent when hit under pressure,[[462]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-462)  especially with a more vulnerable and slower second serve. Since the 2011 season, under Ivan Lendl's coaching, Murray has played a more offensive game and has also worked to improve his second serve, forehand, consistency and mental game which have all been crucial to his further success.[[461]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-How_Andy_Murray_turned_a_second_serve_into_a_lethal_weapon-461)[[463]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-463)[[464]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-464)[[465]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-465)\n\n## Endorsements and equipment\n\nIn 2009, German manufacturer  [Adidas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adidas \"Adidas\")  and Murray signed a five-year-deal worth £30 million. This included wearing their range of tennis shoes.[[466]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-466)  The contract with Adidas allowed Murray to keep his shirt sleeve sponsors  [Shiatzy Chen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiatzy_Chen \"Shiatzy Chen\"),  [Royal Bank of Scotland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Royal_Bank_of_Scotland \"The Royal Bank of Scotland\")  and  [Highland Spring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highland_Spring \"Highland Spring\"). Before he was signed by Adidas in late 2009, he wore Fred Perry apparel.[[467]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-467)  At the end of their contract together Adidas decided not to re-sign with Murray,[[468]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-468)  and he began a 4-year partnership with athletic apparel company  [Under Armour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Under_Armour \"Under Armour\")  in December 2014,[[469]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-469)  reportedly worth $25 million.[[470]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-470)  Murray signed with Castore for the 2019 season which Murray called his last deal before announcing his retirement.[[471]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-471)[[472]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-472)\n\nMurray uses  [Head](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_(company) \"Head (company)\")  rackets, and regularly appears in advertisements for the brand.[[473]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-473)  He endorses the Head Radical Pro model, whereas his actual playing racket (underneath the various Radical Pro paintjobs) is reported to be a customized pro stock PT57A, derived from the original Pro Tour 630 model, but with a 16×19 string pattern.[[474]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-474)[[475]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-475)  The racquet used to be set up extremely heavy at the beginning of his career, but after a 2007 wrist injury its weight was lowered.[[476]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-476)\n\nIn June 2012, the Swiss watch manufacturer  [Rado](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rado_(watch) \"Rado (watch)\")  announced that Murray had signed a deal to wear their D-Star 200 model.[[477]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-477)\n\n## Coaches\n\nMurray's coaching staff has changed through the years and are as follows:  [Leon Smith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leon_Smith_(tennis) \"Leon Smith (tennis)\")  (1998–2004), Pato Álvarez (2003–2005),  [Mark Petchey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Petchey \"Mark Petchey\")  (2005–2006),  [Brad Gilbert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Gilbert \"Brad Gilbert\")  (2006–2007),  [Miles Maclagan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miles_Maclagan \"Miles Maclagan\")  (2007–2010),  [Àlex Corretja](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%80lex_Corretja \"Àlex Corretja\")  (2010–2011),  [Ivan Lendl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivan_Lendl \"Ivan Lendl\")  (2011–2014, 2016–2017),  [Amélie Mauresmo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Am%C3%A9lie_Mauresmo \"Amélie Mauresmo\")  (2014–2016),  [Jonas Björkman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonas_Bj%C3%B6rkman \"Jonas Björkman\")  (2015),[[478]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-478)  [Jamie Delgado](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamie_Delgado \"Jamie Delgado\")  (2016–).[[479]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-479)\n\n## Charitable work\n\nMurray is a founding member of the  [Malaria No More UK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaria_No_More_UK \"Malaria No More UK\")  Leadership Council and helped launch the charity in 2009 with  [David Beckham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Beckham \"David Beckham\"). Footage from the launch at Wembley Stadium can be seen on YouTube and the charity's website.[[480]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-480)  Murray also made 'Nets Needed', a short public service announcement, for the charity to help raise awareness and funds to help in the fight against malaria.[[481]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-481)  Murray has also taken part in several charity tennis events, including the  [Rally for Relief](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Australian_Open#Rally_for_Relief \"2011 Australian Open\")  events that took place prior to the start of the  [2011 Australian Open](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Australian_Open \"2011 Australian Open\").[[482]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-482)\n\nIn June 2013, Murray teamed up with former British No. 1 Tim Henman for a charity doubles match against Murray's coach and eight-time grand slam champion Ivan Lendl, and No. 6 Tomáš Berdych at the  [Queen's Club](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen%27s_Club \"Queen's Club\")  in London. The event named  [Rally Against Cancer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_Aegon_Championships#Rally_Against_Cancer \"2013 Aegon Championships\")  was organised to raise money for Royal Marsden Cancer Charity after his best friend and fellow British player Ross Hutchins was diagnosed with  [Hodgkin's lymphoma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hodgkin%27s_lymphoma \"Hodgkin's lymphoma\").[[483]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-483)[[484]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-484)  The event took place following the final day of competitive play at the  [AEGON Championships](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_Aegon_Championships \"2013 Aegon Championships\"), on Sunday 16 June. Subsequently, following his victory at the tournament, Murray donated his entire prize money pot to  [The Royal Marsden Cancer Charity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Royal_Marsden_NHS_Foundation_Trust \"The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust\").[[485]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-485)\n\nIn June 2014, following the death of  [Elena Baltacha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elena_Baltacha \"Elena Baltacha\")  due to  [liver cancer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_cancer \"Liver cancer\"), Murray featured in an event known as 'Rally for Bally'. Murray played at Queen's Club alongside Victoria Azarenka,  [Martina Hingis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martina_Hingis \"Martina Hingis\"), Heather Watson and his brother Jamie. The event raised money for the Royal Marsden Cancer Charity and the Elena Baltacha Academy of Tennis. Children from Baltacha's academy took to the court to play alongside Murray.[[486]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-486)[[487]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-487)  As a result of his various charitable exploits, Murray was awarded the  [Arthur Ashe Humanitarian of the Year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATP_Arthur_Ashe_Humanitarian_award \"ATP Arthur Ashe Humanitarian award\")  award for 2014.[[488]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray#cite_note-488)",
