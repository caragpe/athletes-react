        "bio": "**Frederick Carlton**  \"**Carl**\"  **Lewis**  (born July 1, 1961) is an American former  [track and field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_and_field \"Track and field\")  athlete who won nine  [Olympic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games \"Olympic Games\")  [gold medals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal \"Gold medal\"), one Olympic silver medal, and 10  [World Championships](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IAAF_World_Championships_in_Athletics \"IAAF World Championships in Athletics\")  medals, including eight gold. His career spanned from 1979 to 1996, when he last won an Olympic event. He is one of only three Olympic athletes who won a gold medal in the same individual event in four consecutive Olympic Games.\n\nLewis was a dominant sprinter and long jumper who topped the world rankings in the  [100 m](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_meters \"100 meters\"),  [200 m](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/200_meters \"200 meters\")  and  [long jump](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_jump \"Long jump\")  events frequently from 1981 to the early 1990s. He set  [world records](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_world_records_in_athletics \"List of world records in athletics\")  in the 100 m,  [4 × 100 m](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4_%C3%97_100_meters_relay \"4 × 100 meters relay\")  and  [4 × 200 m relays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4_%C3%97_200_meters_relay \"4 × 200 meters relay\"), while his  [world record](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_records_in_athletics#Indoor_world_records \"World records in athletics\")  in the indoor long jump has stood since 1984. His 65 consecutive victories in the long jump achieved over a span of 10 years is one of the sport's longest undefeated streaks. Over the course of his athletics career, Lewis broke ten seconds for the 100 meters 15 times and 20 seconds for the 200 meters 10 times. Lewis also long jumped over 28 feet 71 times.\n\nHis accomplishments have led to numerous accolades, including being voted \"World Athlete of the Century\" by the  [International Association of Athletics Federations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Association_of_Athletics_Federations \"International Association of Athletics Federations\")  and \"Sportsman of the Century\" by the  [International Olympic Committee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Olympic_Committee \"International Olympic Committee\"), \"Olympian of the Century\" by  _[Sports Illustrated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_Illustrated \"Sports Illustrated\")_  and \"Athlete of the Year\" by  _[Track & Field News](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_%26_Field_News \"Track & Field News\")_  in 1982, 1983, and 1984.\n\nAfter retiring from his athletics career, Lewis became an actor and has appeared in a number of films. In 2011, he attempted to run for a seat as a  [Democrat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States) \"Democratic Party (United States)\")  in the  [New Jersey Senate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey_Senate \"New Jersey Senate\"), but was removed from the ballot due to the state's residency requirement. Lewis owns a marketing and branding company named C.L.E.G., which markets and brands products and services including his own.\n\n## Athletic career\n### Fame as a competitive athlete[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Carl_Lewis&action=edit&section=2&editintro=Template:BLP_editintro \"Edit section: Fame as a competitive athlete\")]\n\n[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/76/Carl_Lewis_as_a_University_of_Houston_athlete.jpg/220px-Carl_Lewis_as_a_University_of_Houston_athlete.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Carl_Lewis_as_a_University_of_Houston_athlete.jpg)\n\nLewis performing the long jump at the  [University of Houston](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Houston \"University of Houston\")\n\nFrederick Carlton Lewis was born in  [Birmingham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birmingham,_Alabama \"Birmingham, Alabama\"), Alabama, on July 1, 1961, the son of William Lewis (1927–1987)[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Lewis#cite_note-2)  and  [Evelyn née Lawler Lewis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evelyn_Lawler \"Evelyn Lawler\"). His mother was a hurdler on the 1951 Pan-Am team.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Lewis#cite_note-TFNInterview-3)  His older brother  [Cleveland Lewis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Lewis \"Cleveland Lewis\")  played professional soccer for the  [Memphis Rogues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memphis_Rogues \"Memphis Rogues\").[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Lewis#cite_note-4)  His parents ran a local athletics club that provided a crucial influence on both Carl and his sister  [Carol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carol_Lewis \"Carol Lewis\").[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Lewis#cite_note-dadobit-5)  She became an elite long jumper, finishing 9th at the 1984 Olympics and taking bronze at the 1983 World Championships.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Lewis#cite_note-6)\n\nLewis was initially coached by his father, who also coached other local athletes to elite status.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Lewis#cite_note-dadobit-5)  At age 13, Lewis began competing in the long jump, and he emerged as a promising athlete while coached by Andy Dudek and Paul Minore at  [Willingboro High School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willingboro_High_School \"Willingboro High School\")  in his hometown of  [Willingboro Township, New Jersey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willingboro_Township,_New_Jersey \"Willingboro Township, New Jersey\").[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Lewis#cite_note-TFNInterview-3)[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Lewis#cite_note-7)  He achieved the ranking of fourth on the all-time World Junior list of long jumpers.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Lewis#cite_note-TFNInterview-3)\n\nMany colleges tried to recruit Lewis, and he chose to enroll at the  [University of Houston](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Houston \"University of Houston\")  where Tom Tellez was coach. Tellez would thereafter remain Lewis's coach for his entire career. Days after graduating from high school in 1979, Lewis broke the high school long jump record with a leap of 8.13 m (26 ft 8 in).[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Lewis#cite_note-8)  By the end of 1979, Lewis was ranked fifth in the world for the long jump, according to  _Track and Field News_.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Lewis#cite_note-ljworldrank-9)\n\nAn old knee injury had flared up again at the end of the high school year, and this might have had consequences on his fitness. Lewis worked with Tellez and adapted his technique so that he was able to jump without pain, and he went on to win the 1980  [National Collegiate Athletic Association](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Collegiate_Athletic_Association \"National Collegiate Athletic Association\")  (NCAA) title with a wind-assisted jump of 8.35 m (27 ft  4  1⁄2 in).[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Lewis#cite_note-TFNInterview-3)\n\nThough his focus was on the long jump, he was now starting to emerge as a talent in the sprints. Comparisons were beginning to be made with  [Jesse Owens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesse_Owens \"Jesse Owens\"), who dominated sprint and long jump events in the 1930s. Lewis qualified for the American team for the  [1980 Olympics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1980_Summer_Olympics \"1980 Summer Olympics\")  in the long jump and as a member of the 4 × 100 m relay team.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Lewis#cite_note-TFNInterview-3)  The  [Olympic boycott](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1980_Summer_Olympics_boycott \"1980 Summer Olympics boycott\")  precluded Lewis from competing in Moscow; he instead participated in the  [Liberty Bell Classic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberty_Bell_Classic \"Liberty Bell Classic\")  in July 1980, which was an alternate meet for boycotting nations. He jumped 7.77 m (25 ft  5  3⁄4 in) for a bronze medal, and the American 4 × 100 m relay team won gold with a time of 38.61 s.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Lewis#cite_note-10)  Lewis received one of 461  [Congressional Gold Medals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Congressional_Gold_Medal_recipients \"List of Congressional Gold Medal recipients\")  created especially for the athletes precluded from competing in the 1980 Olympics.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Lewis#cite_note-11)  At year's end, Lewis was ranked 6th in the world in the long jump and 7th in the 100 m.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Lewis#cite_note-ljworldrank-9)[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Lewis#cite_note-100worldrank-12)\n\n### Breakthrough in 1981 and 1982\n\nAt the start of 1981, Lewis's best legal long jump was his high school record from 1979. On June 20, Lewis improved his personal best by almost half a meter by leaping 8.62 m (28 ft  3  1⁄4 in) at the  [TAC Championships](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Outdoor_Track_and_Field_Championships \"USA Outdoor Track and Field Championships\")  while still a teenager.[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Lewis#cite_note-13)\n\nWhile marks set at the thinner air of high altitude are eligible for world records,[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Lewis#cite_note-altitude-14)  Lewis was determined to set his records at sea level. In response to a question about his skipping a 1982 long jump competition at altitude, he said, \"I want the record and I plan to get it, but not at altitude. I don't want that '(A)' [for altitude] after the mark.\"[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Lewis#cite_note-15)  When he gained prominence in the early 1980s, all the extant men's 100 m and 200 m records and the long jump record had been set at the  [high altitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1968_in_athletics#Altitude \"1968 in athletics\")  of  [Mexico City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico_City \"Mexico City\").[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Lewis#cite_note-altitude-14)\n\nAlso in 1981, Lewis became the fastest 100 m sprinter in the world. His relatively modest best from 1979 (10.67 s) improved to a world-class 10.21 the next year. But 1981 saw him run 10.00 s at the Southwest Conference Championships in Dallas on May 16, a time that was the third-fastest in history and stood as the low-altitude record.[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Lewis#cite_note-16)  For the first time, Lewis was ranked number one in the world, in both the 100 m and the long jump. He won his first national titles in the 100 m and long jump. Additionally, he won the  [James E. Sullivan Award](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_E._Sullivan_Award \"James E. Sullivan Award\")  as the top amateur athlete in the United States.[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Lewis#cite_note-17)\n\nIn 1982, Lewis continued his dominance, and for the first time it seemed someone might challenge  [Bob Beamon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Beamon \"Bob Beamon\")'s world record of 8.90 m (29 ft  2  1⁄4 in) in the long jump set at the  [1968 Olympics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1968_Summer_Olympics \"1968 Summer Olympics\"), a mark often described as one of the greatest athletic achievements ever.[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Lewis#cite_note-18)  Before Lewis, 28 ft 0 in (8.53 m) had been exceeded on two occasions by two people: Beamon and  [1980 Olympic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1980_Summer_Olympics \"1980 Summer Olympics\")  champion  [Lutz Dombrowski](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lutz_Dombrowski \"Lutz Dombrowski\"). During 1982, Lewis cleared 28 ft 0 in (8.53 m) five times outdoors, twice more indoors, going as far as 8.7 m (28 ft  6  1⁄2 in) at Indianapolis on July 24.[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Lewis#cite_note-19)  He also ran 10.00 s in the 100 m, the world's fastest time, matching his low-altitude record from 1981. He achieved his 10.00 s clocking the same weekend he leapt 8.61 m (28 ft  2  3⁄4 in) twice, and the day he recorded his new low-altitude record 8.76 m (28 ft  8  3⁄4 in) at  [Indianapolis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis \"Indianapolis\"), he had three fouls with his toe barely over the board, two of which seemed to exceed Beamon's record, the third which several observers said reached 30 ft 0 in (9.14 m). Lewis said he should have been credited with that jump, claiming the track officials misinterpreted the rules on fouls.[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Lewis#cite_note-20)\n\nHe repeated his number one ranking in the 100 m and long jump, and ranked number six in the 200 m. Additionally, he was named Athlete of the Year by  _Track and Field News_. From 1981 until 1992, Lewis topped the 100 m ranking six times (seven if  [Ben Johnson's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Johnson_(Canadian_sprinter) \"Ben Johnson (Canadian sprinter)\")  1987 top ranking is ignored), and ranked no lower than third.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Lewis#cite_note-100worldrank-12)  His dominance in the long jump was even greater, as he topped the rankings nine times during the same period, and ranked second in the other years.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Lewis#cite_note-ljworldrank-9)\n\n### 1983 and the inaugural World Championships\n\nThe  [International Association of Athletics Federations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Association_of_Athletics_Federations \"International Association of Athletics Federations\")  (IAAF), the governing body of track and field, organized the first  [World Championships](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IAAF_World_Championships_in_Athletics \"IAAF World Championships in Athletics\")  in 1983. Lewis's chief rival in the long jump was predicted to be the man who last beat him: Larry Myricks. But though Myricks had joined Lewis in surpassing 28 ft 0 in (8.53 m) the year before, he failed to qualify for the American team, and Lewis won at Helsinki with relative ease. His winning leap of 8.55 m (28 ft  1⁄2 in) defeated silver medalist Jason Grimes by 0.26 m (10 in).[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Lewis#cite_note-21)\n\nHe also won the 100 m with relative ease. There,  [Calvin Smith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calvin_Smith \"Calvin Smith\")  who had earlier that year set a new world record in the 100 m at altitude with a 9.93 s performance, was soundly beaten by Lewis 10.07 s to 10.21 s.[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Lewis#cite_note-22)  Smith won the 200 m title,[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Lewis#cite_note-23)  an event which Lewis had not entered, but even there he was partly in Lewis's shadow as Lewis had set an American record in that event earlier that year. He won the 200 m on June 19 at the TAC/Mobil Championships in 19.75 s, the second-fastest time in history and the low-altitude record, only 0.03 s behind  [Pietro Mennea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pietro_Mennea \"Pietro Mennea\")'s 1979 mark. Observers here noted that Lewis probably could have broken the world record if he did not ease off in the final meters to raise his arms in celebration.[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Lewis#cite_note-Field_News'_1983,_p.4,_9-24)[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Lewis#cite_note-25)  Finally, Lewis ran the  [anchor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchor_leg \"Anchor leg\")  in the 4 × 100 m relay, winning in 37.86 s, a new world record and the first in Lewis's career.[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Lewis#cite_note-26)\n\nLewis's year-best performances in the 100 m and long jump were not at the World Championships, but at other meets. He became the first person to run a sub-10 second 100 m at low-altitude with a 9.97 s in  [Modesto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modesto,_California \"Modesto, California\")  on May 14.[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Lewis#cite_note-27)[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Lewis#cite_note-28)  His gold at the World Championships and his other fast times earned him the number one ranking in the world that year, despite Calvin Smith's world record. At the TAC Championships on June 19, he set a new low-altitude record in the long jump, 8.79 m (28 ft 10 in)[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Lewis#cite_note-Field_News'_1983,_p.4,_9-24)  and earned the world number one ranking in that event.[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Lewis#cite_note-29)  _Track and Field News_  ranked him number two in the 200 m, despite his low-altitude record of 19.75 s, behind Smith, who had won gold at Helsinki.[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Lewis#cite_note-200mranking-30)  Lewis was again named Athlete of the Year by the magazine.[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Lewis#cite_note-AOTY-31)",
