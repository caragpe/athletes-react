        "bio": "**Fermín Cacho Ruiz**  (born 16 February 1969) is a  [Spanish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain \"Spain\")  [track and field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_and_field \"Track and field\")  athlete, winner of the  [1500 metres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1500_metres \"1500 metres\")  at the  [1992 Summer Olympics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1992_Summer_Olympics \"1992 Summer Olympics\").\n\nBorn in  [Ágreda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%81greda \"Ágreda\"), Spain, Cacho had an enviable competitive record in the 1500 m, but it wasn't until late in his career that he produced a time of corresponding quality.\n\nCacho's first notable result came in 1990, when he finished second in the 1500 m at the  [European Indoor Championships](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1990_European_Indoor_Championships_in_Athletics \"1990 European Indoor Championships in Athletics\")  in  [Glasgow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glasgow \"Glasgow\"). At the 1991  [World Indoor Championships](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1991_IAAF_World_Indoor_Championships \"1991 IAAF World Indoor Championships\")  in  [Seville](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seville \"Seville\"), Cacho finished again second in the 1500 m, behind  [Noureddine Morceli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noureddine_Morceli \"Noureddine Morceli\").\n\nAt the  [Olympic Games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games \"Olympic Games\")  in  [Barcelona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona \"Barcelona\"), Cacho was not considered a serious gold medal threat. But the Olympic 1500 m final was run at a very pedestrian pace, and Cacho positioned himself perfectly in the final lap, and outsprinted his rivals, with an unprecedented last lap of 50.6 seconds, to win the  [gold medal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal \"Gold medal\")  in 3:40.12.\n\nIn 1993 at  [Stuttgart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuttgart \"Stuttgart\")  in  [World Championships](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1993_World_Championships_in_Athletics \"1993 World Championships in Athletics\"), Cacho finished second, but took the 1500 m title at the  [European Championships](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1994_European_Championships_in_Athletics#Track \"1994 European Championships in Athletics\")  in  [Helsinki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helsinki \"Helsinki\")  in the next year. In  [World Championships](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1995_World_Championships_in_Athletics \"1995 World Championships in Athletics\")  at  [Gothenburg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gothenburg \"Gothenburg\"), Cacho only finished in eighth place.\n\nAfter a relatively lean year in 1995, Cacho was back to his best in the early part of the 1996 season, leading up to the  [Olympic Games in Atlanta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1996_Summer_Olympics \"1996 Summer Olympics\"). Although Cacho was the defending  [Olympic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games \"Olympic Games\")  1500 m champion, the final in  [Atlanta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta,_Georgia \"Atlanta, Georgia\")  was considered to be a match race between Morceli and  [Hicham El Guerrouj](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hicham_El_Guerrouj \"Hicham El Guerrouj\"), who had filled the first two places at the previous year's World Championships. Approaching the completion of the third lap, Morceli was leading from El Guerrouj, when suddenly the Moroccan tripped and fell. In taking evasive action, Cacho was forced to leap over the fallen El Guerrouj, in a manoeuvre which he later estimated had lost him 5 metres of ground to Morceli, who had commenced his final lap sprint for the finish. Cacho chased Morceli around the last lap, but was unable to catch him. In the end Morceli won by 5 metres from the second-placed Cacho.\n\nAt the  [World Championships](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1997_World_Championships_in_Athletics \"1997 World Championships in Athletics\")  in  [Athens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athens \"Athens\")  in 1997, Cacho won a  [silver medal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal \"Silver medal\")  again, and at the end of the same season he finally managed to run his world class time, when he finished second at the 1500 m behind El Guerrouj with a time of 3:28.95, which moved him to third on the all-time world list behind Morceli and El Guerrouj. He won the  [bronze medal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal \"Bronze medal\")  at the  [1998 European Championships](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1998_European_Championships_in_Athletics#Track \"1998 European Championships in Athletics\")  in  [Budapest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budapest \"Budapest\"), and finished fourth in the  [World Championships](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1999_World_Championships_in_Athletics \"1999 World Championships in Athletics\")  at Seville in 1999. Cacho suffered an  [Achilles' tendon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achilles%27_tendon \"Achilles' tendon\")  injury in 2000, causing him to miss the opportunity to add to his Olympic gold and silver medals at  [2000 Summer Olympics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000_Summer_Olympics \"2000 Summer Olympics\")  in  [Sydney](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney \"Sydney\").\n\nHe held the  [European record](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_European_records_in_athletics \"List of European records in athletics\")  at 1500 m with a time of 3:28.95 for 16 years (1997–2013), until  [Mo Farah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mo_Farah \"Mo Farah\")  broke it with a time of 3:28.81.",
